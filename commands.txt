To run the code of our desired edge length guided algorithm go to:
https://github.com/abureyanahmed/multi_level_tree


The code of the algorithm is in the "desirable_length_guided" folder. To run the algorithm you need to create some javascript files. Take a file from the "dataset/" folder. Then run it with the "print_javascript_data_topics.py" file which will print the necessary js objects, store them into a js file. Then import it in the "avoiding_crossing_by_initialization.html" file using a script tag. Open the html file in a browser and you will be able to run the algorithm and download the output.
